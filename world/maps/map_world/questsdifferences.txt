Code structure completely different

The example is completely different (and more jokey)

EXAMPLES:

	////// BETA 1 //////
//[quests]
//{
//   [*]
//    {
//        name            = Quest_for_Gyorn;		                // This is the name of the quest, it MUST be unique per map!
//        speaker         = "Norick";                             // The name of the speaker
//        speaker_role    = "Old Man";                       		// The "role" or occupation of the speaker
//        description     = "Seek out Gyorn in Stonebridge.";		// This is the line that appears underneath the speaker name
//        sample          = s_v_fh_norick1.mp3;                   // The dialogue sound file associated with this quest
//    }
	

	////// RELEASE //////

//{
//	[quest_for_gyorn]
//	{		
//		chapter			= chapter_1;

//		
//		[*]
//		{

//			address		= fh_r1:conversations:conversation_norick;  
//			play_update_sound = false;
//		}
//		[*]
//		{
//			order		= 1;
//			speaker     = "Skartis";
//			description = "Seek Norick's friend Gyorn in the town of Stonebridge by using the old path through the Crypts.";

//		}
//	}
	
The wording around Gyorn's quest was slightly different. From "Seek *out* Gyorn in Stonebridge" to just "Seek Gyorn in Stonebridge"
	
Escorting Ulora to Stonebridge was a quest.

Escorting Gyorn to Glacern was a quest.

A character named Ilandro had a quest for you to find their friends. 

Ilandro's quest used s_v_bt_gyorn1.mp3 as a placeholder audio sample.
